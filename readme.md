Taskobra is a lightweight and easy way to manage Windows schedules programmatically. Taskobra can also execute your code as a Windows service.  

It uses Powershell commands under the hood to create and delete tasks in the scheduler:  
```python
from taskobra import Task

task = Task('TaskName', 'TaskFolder\\')
task.set_schedule('-Daily -At 13:00:00')
task.delete_task() # DELETES THE TASK ONLY IF EXISTS
task.create_task('PATH/TO/SCRIPT.py', 'USERNAME') # WITH LOGGED IN USER 
task.create_task('PATH/TO/SCRIPT.py', 'USERNAME', 'PASSWORD')  # WITH OTHER USER
# ADDED IN v0.0.2 ###############
# Enable disable a task
task.disable_task()
task.enable_task()
# Start/Stop a Task
task.run_task()
task.stop_task()
# Last Run Info
task.get_last_run()
print(task.last_run)
```
As of v0.0.3 this package can also create and manage windows services (you'll need to download NSSM, check out the Installation paragraph):
```python
from taskobra import Service

service = Service("MyService")
service.create_service("PATH/TO/SCRIPT.py")
service.start_service()
```
